## About Rails to Go

Rails to Go originated as a presentation for India Gopher Conf 2015. The format for the presentation was only 20 minutes and I felt like we could provide more content than time allowed. Hence the birth of this project.

Whether you are coming to GoLang as a Ruby on Rails developer out of curiousity, or as a neccassity, I hope that the Rails oriented approach will help you understand your next steps.
